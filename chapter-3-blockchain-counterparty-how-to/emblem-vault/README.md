# Emblem Vault

Up to this moment, everything related to Pepes happened on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the meantime, the Ethereum ecosystem gave birth to a thriving industry around NFTs. NFT artworks, collectibles and in-game assets were bought by the millions. OpenSea became the leading marketplace for Ethereum based NFTs. That's when Emblem Vault came up with a solution.

The Emblem Vault (developed by [Circuits of Value](https://circuitsofvalue.com/)) is a tokenized multi-asset wallet that let's users trade tokens from any blockchain on ANY EVM based blockchain. An Emblem Vault is an NFT container that can hold supported ERC20 type tokens as well as digital assets, including ERC-721 or ERC-1155 tokens.

Imagine you minted an Ethereum NFT box, a container. Then you managed to store a Counterparty asset inside of that box. Once you achieve that you are now able to trade that box on OpenSea, because it now resides on the Ethereum blockchain. This means having access to the massive market of Ethereum NFT buyers. In a few words, that's what [Emblem Vault](https://opensea.io/collection/emblem-vault) does.

It's used to wrap NFTs from other blockchains, even the ones that predate the ERC-721 NFT standard, onto the Ethereum blockchain, making them easily tradable on marketplaces. Emblem Vault has enabled the display of XCP assets on the popular ETH-centric NFT marketplace [OpenSea](http://www.opensea.io). This move brought Rare Pepes out of the backchannels of XCP-based wallets to the mainstream NFT collector community.

Many pepe cards have made it into the other side of the ocean thanks to this innovation, and therefore now some of the units in the collections can be purchased in ETH and stored in Ethereum wallets.

This is probably the easiest way of acquiring a Rare Pepe, but as a wrapped token.\
When buying a Rare Pepe this way, make sure that it contains a real Rare Pepe, not a fake Rare Pepe, by checking the name of the Rare Pepe on the [Rare Pepe Directory](http://rarepepedirectory.com/).
