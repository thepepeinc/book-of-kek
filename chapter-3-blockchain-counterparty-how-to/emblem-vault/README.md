# Emblem Vault

Up to this moment, everything related to Pepes happened on the Bitcoin blockchain. In the meantime, the Ethereum ecosystem gave birth to a thriving industry around NFTs. NFT artworks, collectibles and in-game assets were bought by the millions. OpenSea became the leading marketplace for Ethereum based NFTs. That's when Emblem Vault came up with a solution.

The Emblem Vault (developed by [Circuits of Value](https://circuitsofvalue.com/)) is a tokenized multi-asset wallet that lets users trade tokens from any blockchain to ANY EVM compatible blockchain. An Emblem Vault is an NFT container that can hold supported ERC20 type tokens as well as digital assets, including ERC-721 or ERC-1155 tokens.

### How does it work?

[Emblem Vault](https://opensea.io/collection/emblem-vault) is used to wrap NFTs from other blockchains, even the ones that predate the ERC-721 NFT standard, to trade them on the Ethereum blockchain, making them easily exchangeable on larger marketplaces, enabling the display of XCP assets on the popular marketplace [OpenSea](http://www.opensea.io). Rare Pepe collections can now be purchased in ETH and stored in Ethereum wallets. This move brought Rare Pepes out of the backchannels of XCP-based wallets to a larger collector community.

Imagine you minted an Ethereum NFT box or container, and you managed to store a Counterparty asset inside of that box. You are now able to trade that box on OpenSea, as it now resides on the Ethereum blockchain. This means having access to a much larger market of collectors on Ethereum. Many Pepe cards have made it into the other side of the world thanks to this innovation.

This is probably the easiest way of acquiring a Rare Pepe, but as a wrapped token.\
When buying a Rare Pepe this way, make sure that it contains a real Rare Pepe, not a fake Rare Pepe, by checking the name of the card on the [Rare Pepe Directory](http://rarepepedirectory.com/).
