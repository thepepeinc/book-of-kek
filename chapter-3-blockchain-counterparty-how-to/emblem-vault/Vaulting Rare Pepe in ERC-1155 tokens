# **Vaulting Rare Pepe in ERC-1155 tokens**

In May 2023, after a test phase, Emblem Vault opened the vaulting of Rare Pepe XCP assets in ERC-1155 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain to the public. Other collections (Fake Rare, Fake Common, Dank Rare) will be available in the same standard.

This innovation has led to the creation of a dedicated page on marketplaces, such as Opensea, named Rare Pepe (2016 - 2018). This makes it quicker and better to identify the Rare Pepe collection than the Emblem Vault Legacy collection, which grouped all the collections on the same page.

On this page, each Rare Pepe card appears only once, the ERC-1155 assets corresponding to the same card being stacked (the number of identical vaulted cards is specified). Assets are named in the format NAME | Series # Card #, and display four traits (Series #, Card #, Total Supply, Year). This makes it easier to identify each Rare Pepe card and its features, compared with the Emblem Vault Legacy collection which contains multiple assets corresponding to the same cards, or multi-card packages. This also makes it possible to make an offer to all the holders of a same card.

The vaulting process is very similar to the creation of an Emblem Vault Legacy (vault generation, sending of the XCP asset to the tokenized wallet, payment of COVAL and mint), but it is necessary to use a dedicated page (named Create Curated) on the Emblem Finance website and choose the Rare Pepe collection and the name of the card to be placed in the tokenized wallet.

This innovation also makes it possible, in partnership with Pepe.wtf, to pay royalties resulting from transactions to the artists who created the Rare Pepe vaulted cards.
