Scarce.city was started by [Chris Tramount](https://twitter.com/ctramount) and [Aryan Jabbari](https://twitter.com/AryanJabbari) with the help of honorary founder [Chiefmonkey](https://twitter.com/HodlrDotRocks) who seeded the artist community and had the original idea for the Lightning Auctions.

> _“We believe that Bitcoin’s finest goods should be sold according to the network’s properties of pseudonymous, borderless, permissionless, trust minimized, and verifiable authenticity and supply.”_

Scarce.city’s first major product was [Lightning Auctions](https://scarce.city/blog/introducing-lightning-auctions), which keeps auction participants accountable by collateralizing their bids through instant, low fee Lightning Network payments.

#### **Step 1:**

Deposit a small percentage of your bid as collateral and just top it off for additional bid&#x73;**.**&#x20;

Bid deposits capped at 500K sats in case you want to ape in while staying within your Lightning comfort zon&#x65;**.**

#### **Step 2:**

The winning bidder has 4 hours to pay their bid. If they don't, they lose their collateral and the next highest bidder has a chance to pay their high bi&#x64;**.**

#### **Step 3:**

Once the item is paid for, deposits are refunded to the remaining participants.

#### **HOT ZONE RULES:**

* Bids placed in the final 10 minutes of the auction reset the countdown to 10 minutes
* Auction can't end with a pending bid
* O&#x6E;**-**&#x63;hain bid deposits no longer accepted
