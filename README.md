# The Book of Kek

## What is the Book of Kek?

The **Book Of Kek** is an open repository that aims to tell the fascinating story of Pepe the Frog. While Pepe was at first a simple cartoon character created by the artist [Matt Furie](chapter-1-historical-lore/the-creator-matt-furie.md), the versatile frog quickly took over the internet, adopting a life of its own, before becoming **the universal meme** that he is today.&#x20;

In this book we aggregated as much information, links and tutorials as possible, with the goal to present not only Pepe's history, but also the lore surrounding [Rare Pepes](chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/), [Fake Rares and Dank Rares](chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/fake-rares-and-dank-rares/) (NFT trading cards on the [Counterparty](chapter-3-blockchain-counterparty-how-to/counterparty-what-is-it/) Blockchain), as well as the [latest news](pepe-news-outlet/) from the wider Pepe community.&#x20;

We invite you to take a deep dive down the Pepe frog hole... üê∏
