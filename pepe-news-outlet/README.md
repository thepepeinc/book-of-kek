On February 4th, 2023, notable collector and artist [VincentVanDough](https://twitter.com/Vince_Van_Dough) released his first open edition: [Pepe Checks](https://app.manifold.xyz/c/pepechecks).

_After 6 years of being molded in the depths of Counterparty, Pepes are coming to Ethereum._

RPW creator Joe Looney announced the next step in the evolution of RarePepeWallet: [rpw.wtf](https://rpw.wtf)

...now with **hardware wallet support**! (Ledger Nano S / S Plus / X).

While [rarepepewallet.com](https://t.co/tVuoQN0wm5) will remain mostly unchanged as an homage to the early days of crypto art, [rpw.wtf](https://t.co/tbPCY7pZLu) is a new platform for collectors to manage their collections of Rare Pepes, Fake Rares, Fake Commons and Dank Rares.

<div><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/RPW Hardware Support.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/RPW WTF.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

[Rpw.wtf](https://t.co/uT5yNdQKZG) is built on a modern framework and optimized for use on both desktop and mobile. You can even use it on Android with a hardware wallet!

Over the next weeks and months, Joe Looney will be working with [@al\_fernandz](https://twitter.com/al_fernandz) to build a synergy between rpw.wtf and pepe.wtf, to create a one stop shop for creating and collecting in the Pepe ecosystem. Currently, you can sign into your pepe.wtf profile directly from rpw (more to come...)

<div><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/RPW  Pepe.wtf.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/RPW Hardware Support (2).jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

As with development on the original RarePepeWallet, Joe remains open to any and all feedback from users!

_"What a crazy 6 years it's been, looking forward to continuing to build out tools that make it easier for everyone to participate in this special corner of the internet."  - Joe Looney_

## Pepe.wtf introduces new Basket feature for picking multiple cards

In a recent tweet, [Pepe.wtf](../chapter-4-latest-developments/pepe.wtf.md) creator [@al\_fernandz](https://twitter.com/al_fernandz) announced a new feature to better the Drops page UX:&#x20;

"_In our mission of helping artist to distribute and collectors to collect, we have been working on something... We are trying to make the process of buying drops, specially_ [_Commons_](../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/fake-rares-and-dank-rares/fake-commons/) _and_ [_Danks_](../dank-rares/)_, more comfortable for those who want to pick multiple cards."_

As part of the new feature, you can add them to the basket and then check out without having to fill the same form for each card. You can still change that information in case you want to specify a different delivery or payment address.

<div><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Bulk Basket Feature.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Bulk Basket Feature 2.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

Created as a homage to collectors, FAKEVERSE (capped at 100 cards) goes beyond static visuals and rarity metrics by reflecting the activity of its holders in real time. In the Fakeverse, holders with the same amount of cards live together on different planets and can view the assets on the interactive page here: [http://pepe.wtf/fakeverse](http://pepe.wtf/fakeverse)

Every planet represents a group of holders with the same number of cards, the closer they are to the star the danker they live in the universe.

## Matt Kane's NOTKAMOTO card launches S8 of Fake Rares

July 1st, 2022 ; [source](https://twitter.com/Vince_Van_Dough/status/1542964638450479104?s=20\&t=U2PT7wtbkflif8EHXwelZQ)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/NOTKAMOTO.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="https://pepe.wtf/asset/NOTKAMOTO">NOTKAMOTO</a></p></figcaption></figure>

As the first NFT by artist [Matt Kane](https://twitter.com/MattKaneArtist) on the Bitcoin blockchain, NOTKAMOTO was minted at the [end of day June 10th](https://xchain.io/asset/NOTKAMOTO) as a master copy tribute to the original [RAREPEPE Nakamoto Card](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RAREPEPE), created by anonymous artist Mike in September 2016.

Released as an edition of 300 (mirroring the supply of the original RAREPEPE), The Notkamoto Card is the first and only time Matt Kane has deviated from his long-standing tradition of minting unique 1/1s. It’s also included as the first in [Series 8 of FakeRares](https://fakeraredirectory.com/series-8/) curated by a long-standing collector and purveyor of fine art, [VincentVanDough.](https://twitter.com/Vince_Van_Dough)

**About the artist:**

As referenced on the [official Notkamoto site](https://notkamotos.club/), Kane is known for using custom generative software to digitally paint master copies of original masterpieces.

However, with NOTKAMOTO he challenges the standard practice of the master copy genre by applying his unique designs - a stylistic practice that started in 2006, three years before the advent of Bitcoin and when he just began programming.

> _“The most compelling brushstrokes to consider emulating in this new paradigm has less to do with image, more to do with honoring the culture, memes, exhibition history, provenance, market, technology, and general context that surround a masterpiece NFT.”_ - Kane

**Community Initiative:**

[As mentioned on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MattKaneArtist/status/1542952953400549376?s=20\&t=NrD6EAPHU7POOtTr6MvDNQ), 69 patronage editions will shortly become available on a dispenser for 1 BTC each. To become eligible for a NOTKAMOTO, Kanes has detailed the process and conditions [here](https://twitter.com/MattKaneArtist/status/1542952953400549376?s=20\&t=NrD6EAPHU7POOtTr6MvDNQ):

{% embed url="https://twitter.com/MattKaneArtist/status/1542952953400549376?s=20&t=NrD6EAPHU7POOtTr6MvDNQ" %}

Alongside exhibiting work in [Sotheby’s 2021 Natively Digital auction](https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2021/natively-digital-a-curated-nft-sale-2/meules-after-claude-monet?locale=en), Kanes also has a [“Gazers” discord](../chapter-4-latest-developments/pepe-news-outlet/discord.gg/gazers/) named after his [Art Blocks collection](https://www.artblocks.io/project/215) where people can talk about NOTKAMOTO.

Ultimately, while the original RAREPEPE Nakamoto card served as the progenitor of the [CryptoArt movement](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/1/14/what-is-cryptoart), Notkamoto by Kanes is a shining example of a work that reflects the current state of digital craftsmanship and dank culture.

### How it all Began

On September 21 2021, [Rare Scrilla](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Rare-Scrilla) was banned from the [Rare Pepe Trading Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/QJdrG2ehHAfk5lKw) group for violating the number one rule: you can only share Official Rare Pepes in the Rare Pepe Trading Group. Rare Scrilla shared a Fake Rare that was rejected from the directory in 2018. You see, Scrilla had just rediscovered the fake in his wallet, so he figured he’d share it in the chat and give a few away to people who shared their addresses. He was quickly banned from the chat, so he decided to spin up a new chat and subsequent directory called Fake Rares. The [new chat](https://t.me/OFFICIALFAKERARES) quickly filled up, and Scrilla offered the FREEDOMKEK card – the fake that got him fake banned in the first place – to anyone who shared the card in the Rare Pepe chat.

It was a “Proof of Ban” card and thus became the first card in the Fake Rare directory. Series 0, Card 1. The Rare Pepe administrators eventually unbanned Scrilla and even participated in the new Fake Rares community, and the rest has been written on the blockchain.

### The Faka Nostra Holdup

Scrilla was having difficulties managing the website, so he recruited the Austrian Connect and his wife take over that shit. He was sorting through hundreds of submissions using a proton mail account, which is garbage even if you know how to use email. Scrilla is first and foremost, an artist and musician… the technical stuff… not his forte. He needed a Queen of Cards to help curate the collection and a Meme Lord Tech Guru to elevate the website and keep the chat fakeasf. Enter [Fake Annie](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Fake-Annie) and [Indelible](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Indelible). Shit ran smooth for maybe a week, but ultimately, they were hacked by a team of Eastern European gangstas – the squad called themselves [La Faka Nostra](https://twitter.com/LaFakaNostra) – around Series 2. They threatened the team, stole their memes and overtook the chat… they had DJPEPE at gun point and made him give up password access to Fakes.

La Faka used Scrilla, Fake Annie and Indelible as their slaves until [Ghostface Killa](https://twitter.com/GhostfaceKillah) from Wu Tang Clan showed up. GFK defeated La Faka and rescued Fake Rares, dropping hot hot fire in Series 4 with original audio tracks. But when Ghostface went on tour, La Faka stole back the directory in a late-night escapade, even demanding tribute from the community in the form of subassets.

### Reconquering the Fakes

The next 100+ cards were dictated by this elite group of balaclava wearing hood rats, but something happened towards the end of [Series 7](https://pepe.wtf/new/collections/Fake-Rares)… one late night in America, Fake Annie caught La Faka slipping. She discovered they were working with a South African cartel and – don’t ask how – she forced the South Africans to give up sensitive info on La Faka. When Scrilla presented this info to La Faka, they reluctantly gave back the directory, not wanting to be exposed. In a last-ditch effort to wreak havoc, they nuked the site… but thankfully, the assets were untouchable. Left with a mess, Scrilla and Fake Annie were forced to moonlight as website devs… they would normally have relied on Indelible to work his magic, but he was seemingly kidnapped by La Faka and has since disappeared. (We hope to see Indelible back one day and will pay La Faka a good fake dollar to retrieve his whereabouts.) They were able to get the site back up, though it’s still jankyasf and missing half the data…

Now, after a long and brutal war, we are charging forward, counting our blessings and focusing on our exceptional community. In celebratory fashion, Fake Annie and Scrilla have decided to let the most Pepe of all Pepe collectooooors, [Vincent Van Dough](https://pepe.wtf/artists/VVD), bring peace to the Fake Rare universe by curating Series 8. This gives them time to recalibrate, so we can all get back to doing hood rat shit with our frens.
