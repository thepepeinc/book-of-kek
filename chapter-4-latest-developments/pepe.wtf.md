## Features

The platform wants to make the initial stages of the Pepe experience much easier. You can [browse the site](https://pepe.wtf/catalogue) to find the best plays by series, but also by [Artists](https://pepe.wtf/artists) and [Sets](https://pepe.wtf/sets), a long-desired feature by the community.

The site also features a [Leaderboard](https://pepe.wtf/leaderboard) of all wallets carrying Pepe Cards, sorted by highest number of cards collected, with the current leader owning an impressive collection of 1680/1774 unique cards.

Its built-in marketplace aggregator makes the world of Pepe much more digestible to even the greenest of Pepe enthusiasts.

## Pepe.wtf team

Pepe.wtf is the brainchild of [@pepe](https://twitter.com/pepe) himself and [Carbono](https://carbono.com/).

![Al](../.gitbook/assets/alpfp.png) ![Miguel](../.gitbook/assets/miguelpfp.png) ![Pepe](<../.gitbook/assets/pepe pfp.png>) ![Raul](../.gitbook/assets/raulpfp.png)

[@pepe](https://twitter.com/pepe) is the NFT-collecting, Pepe-hoarding alter ego of a true crypto believer.

[Carbono](https://twitter.com/carbono\_com) is a crypto company that does some serious [consulting](https://carbono.com/), some serious [investing](https://abacus.carbono.com/), some serious [NFTing](https://botto.com/) and then some other things for the lulz.

> "We joined forces to shed some light and share some alpha on the intricate world of Rare Pepes."

* [Pepe](https://twitter.com/pepe) brought all the wisdom acquired from a troubled history of collecting frogs
* [Al](https://twitter.com/al\_fernandz), Carbono's shadowy super coder, took to the keyboard and untangled Matrix.
* [Raúl](https://twitter.com/raulmarcosl) and [Miguel](https://twitter.com/miguelatcarbono) sang cheerful songs, sent stickers and ate cashews on the sidelines.

Pepe.wtf is their humble contribution to the exciting universe of Pepes.

> _“This is a self funded, non-for-profit project born from passion and fun. We might scoop a few Pepes here and there ourselves, but there is no business model behind it. We have done our best to make everything work flawlessly, but Rare Pepes are a complicated collection. Al has only two hands and 24 hours in his day (he refuses to sleep or eat), but there might be bugs or mistakes here and there. We are eager to listen to the community and try to accommodate, so let us know if you find something that's off, something that doesn't work... Also let us know what you like. We have feelings.”_
