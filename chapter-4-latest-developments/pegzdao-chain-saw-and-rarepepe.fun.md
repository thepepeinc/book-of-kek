## **PegzDAO**

[PEGZ](https://www.pegz.fun/) ([@PegzDAO](https://twitter.com/PegzDAO)) is a series of 100 unique collectables, each one of a kind and drawn digitally by [Matt Furie](https://mattfurie.com/). Every Peg character is a member of a family, one of 10 types, including "Pepe" who is present here in the rarest of forms.

Matt's vast world of characters come to life in the form of collectable/tradable files, each with a 2D avatar .PNG file, a 3D .GLB coin file, and an animated .GIF file.

Every 10 PEGZ is a [PEPE](https://www.pegz.fun/family/peper), and after every 30 PEGZ plops a [DAZZLER](https://www.pegz.fun/family/dazzler). The last of the Dazzler family ([Peg 103](https://www.pegz.fun/asset/peg-103)) sold for 269.42 ETH to collector [VincentVanDough](https://twitter.com/Vince_Van_Dough) in 2021.

The PEGZ project came about as Matt focused on digitally created work, and provided a unique opportunity for collectors to get into his vast universe of bizarre mutants and characters, the same universe that single-handedly spawned the most iconic internet creature of all time, Pepe the Frog.

PEGZ is operated by [Chain/Saw](https://www.chainsaw.fun/), a space for artists and collectors to both create and experiment with new digital art.

## **Chain/Saw**

[Chain/Saw](https://www.chainsaw.fun/) ([@ChainSawNFT](https://twitter.com/ChainSawNFT)) is a space for artists and collectors to both create and experiment with a new digital art paradigm, and ultimately shape it. Chain/Saw also operates [PEGZ](http://pegz) in a joint venture with Matt Furie.

As an NFT marketplace, Chain/Saw presents a curated selection of visionary projects that call into question what blockchain art can be.

Chain/Saw was founded by [Frank Musarra](http://heartsofdarknesses.es/), an artist, musician, and creative technologist deeply embedded at the intersection of art and technology.

The project arose through conversations with peers who shared a common curiosity with this emergent space, though with this curiosity comes trepidation — what does the future of NFT art look like? What are the implications of this movement for “legacy” art worlds?

Chain/Saw was founded to further the challenging conversation surrounding the future of digital art, engaging a community of artists, inspired collectors, and curious audiences alike.

## **RarePepe.fun**

[The Rare Pepe Collection](https://www.rarepepes.fun/) is the latest lovechild of Matt Furie’s creative genius and Chain/Saw.

RarePepe.fun is Matt Furie’s take on Rare Pepes today:

> _“You are about to experience the slap and mystery which reaches from the deepest inner mind to the outer limits._
>
> _Behind the curtain is the key to imagination, a dimension of mind entangled in the plight of a frog._
>
> _Pepe the Frog._
>
> _You are traveling to a land of darkness and light._
>
> _Sadness and delight._
>
> _Welcome to Rare Pepe.”_

Some of the collectibles can also be found on the projects OpenSea page [here](https://opensea.io/collection/rarepepe-by-matt-furie).
