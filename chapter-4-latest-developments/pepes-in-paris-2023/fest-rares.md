# Fest Rares Cards

During Pepefest 2023 which was held in Paris, France Rare Pepe Scientist and creator of [rarepepewallet.com](../../chapter-3-blockchain-counterparty-how-to/best-pepe-wallets.md#rare-pepe-wallet) Joe Looney held two seminars where he debuted his new mobile wallet rpw.wtf and taught those in attendance how to use it to mint a token on Counterparty. As part of the presentation, Joe created what he called a "Mint Pass" which was a piece of paper with a QR code on it. The code led to a Counterparty wallet with enough Bitcoin and XCP to mint a token.&#x20;

Prior to the event, Joe minted 2 tokens to be sure the system was working as expected. They are [MINTPASSTEST](https://xchain.io/asset/MINTPASSTEST) and [MINTPEPEPASS](https://xchain.io/asset/MINTPEPEPASS). To verify the simplicity of the process, Joe had his mom (presumably a non-techy person) mint a token as well. It is titled [PEACENIKPEPE](https://xchain.io/asset/PEACENIKPEPE). In it, "Mamo" writes "Not sure she understands NFTs."&#x20;

A website was quickly spun up just days after the event by xxx. The address is [festrares.siteoly.com](https://festrares.siteoly.com/).&#x20;

You can find a downloadable 24" x 36" poster of all the Fest Rare cards [here](https://amethyst-jealous-bass-210.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTJ7RBLNUddABe7bbrDqMAxq67JUPNvwMm7Qj9NMP2j82). The poster was created by [subterranean](https://twitter.com/subterranean\_1).&#x20;
