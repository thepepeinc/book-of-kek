# The Artist's Journey

{% hint style="info" %}
[Rare Pepe](../../../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/), [Fake Rare](../../../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/fake-rares-and-dank-rares/fake-rare-artists.md) and Ethereum artists were the first to produce Pepe cards to be distributed under Series 1 of the Notables collection, before submissions became open to all artists in traditional Pepe fashion (with submission rules and scientists overseeing dankness).
{% endhint %}

The [Fake Rare submission rules](../../../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/fake-rares-and-dank-rares/fake-rares-submission-rules.md) will be in place for the Notables collection. Series 1 were mostly Rare Pepe and Fake Rare artists, with some curated artists from Ethereum.

Submissions are now to any artist through a [submission portal](https://pepe.wtf/submission) on pepe.wtf, checked by a dedicated team of Pepe scientists to ensure dankness. Find all submission requirements and the detailed process on [https://pepe.wtf/submission](https://pepe.wtf/submission).

Once a submission is accepted, a [Pepe Cheques](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Cheques) will be required to be burnt to have the art entered into the [Notable Pepes](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) directory.

There is an initial supply of 2,000 Pepe Cheques that is distributed as follows.

**Pepe Cheques can be acquired in 3 ways:**

1. Any artist will be able to claim a Pepe Check any time by buying and burning a [FAKEASF](https://pepe.wtf/asset/FAKEASF) card on Counterparty (by adding the ETH address in the transaction memo of a FAKEASF destruction). Since there were 1350 FAKEASF in circulation at the time of writing, 1350 of the 2000 Pepe Cheques were earmarked for this type of claim.
2. There was also an initial airdrop in two phases:
   1. The first was to artists who have submitted a Rare Pepe or Fake Rare. The airdrop was based on a snapshot of registered ETH addresses on **Friday, 17th February at 5PM EST**.
   2. After the Pepe Cheques for artists were allocated, the remaining ones were distributed randomly to Pepe Checks holders.
3. The final way to acquire a Pepe Cheques is to buy one on secondary market on Ethereum.

Supply for most cards in series 2 will be in the range of 100-200, however we may loosen up our standards here to allow for some sub-100 issuance cards or very high issuance cards. Similarly, we may experiment with different pricing on cards with such supply.
