# How It Works

Notables are the latest Pepe collection, launched on the Ethereum blockchain.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some of the parameters in this document are hardcoded into the collection, but others may evolve as the collection progresses.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**TL;DR:**

* Each **Sunday at 4:20 PM EST**, 5 new cards will be released
* All [Notable Pepe](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) holdings are used in determining allowlists for the latest mint. Each card, regardless of supply, gives equal weighting to its holder in allowlist selection.
* [Pepe Cheques](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Cheques) are used to secure winning art submissions into the notables registry. Eligible submissions must be made via the [submission portal](https://pepe.wtf/submission) on [pepe.wtf](../../pepe.wtf.md). Cheques are not required until a submission has been confirmed as a winner.
* 50 cards per Notable Pepes series
* Cards Price = 0.069 ETH (different pricing might apply on cards with higher supply)
* Supply = 100 to 1000 per card
* One wallet can win multiple AL spots for each mint
* AL for each week's drop can be found on [pepe.wtf](../../pepe.wtf.md)
* For Series 2, 10% of the available supply from each drop is allocated to a second AL1 raffle for full set [Series 1](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) holders
* PNP claims from a given week will end around the time drops for the week wrap up
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Coming soon**: The [Pepe.wtf](../../pepe.wtf.md) team is working on a dashboard where you can sign in with an ETH address and see any claims available for you and any drops you are able to mint without needing to search each AL individually.
