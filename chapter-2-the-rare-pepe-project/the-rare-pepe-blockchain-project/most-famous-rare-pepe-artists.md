This first threat was later closed, as Mike did perceive it's creation and posting as a highjack to his idea. This was the first time a Rarepepe was created by somebody else than Mike. In 2022, KARPEPELES was submitted to Series 0 of the Fake Rare Directory. It can be regarded as the first Fake Rare ever.
