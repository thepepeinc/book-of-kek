# Famous Rare Pepe auctions

## **The “RARE AF” auction**

The first ever Rare Pepe card auction was held at the first [Rare Digital Art Festival](https://raredigitalartfestival.splashthat.com/), aka “RARE AF”.

It was held on the 13th of January 2018, in the offices of Rise New York. The event was announced only a few weeks earlier, but an impressive amount of people had shown up. Crypto enthusiasts, meme aficionados, artists, gamers and collectors were all present. DJ Pepe and DJ Scrilla were there also.

The bidding was held in PEPECASH, and started off with a diptych of Salvador Dali-inspired Pepes. The bidding started at 5,000 PEPECASH and ended at 12,000 PEPECASH. Matt Hall, the creator of Crypto Punks, called it “an amazing deal.”

500 Kekistan passports were issued and went for 20,000 PEPECASH.

20 animated Japanese-watercolor Pepe by the celebrated artist [DaVinci9](https://twitter.com/DavinciNine) sold for 26,000 PEPECASH.

A [RAREPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RAREPEPE), 1 of 300 ever made, was scooped for a whooping 60,000 PEPECASH.

However, the star of the show was definitely [HOMERPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/HOMERPEPE), a 1 of 1 Rare Pepe card.

The bidding started at 20,000 PEPECASH and quickly surpassed 100,000. The excitement rose and the bidding was down to two individuals.

Homer Pepe was sold for a mind-melting 350,000 PEPECASH ($39,200 at the time), making it the most expensive Pepe card sold by that time.

Due to the excitement in the room, both individuals actually stood up to claim their reward, thinking they won. The winner had to be determined by a coin flip.

In the end Peter Kell, an internet marketer and entrepreneur, became the proud owner of the HOMERPEPE card. People openly mocked Peter for this purchase but he knew what he had. Memes were art.

In March 2021, HOMERPEPE sold for 205ETH ($320,000 at the time). This event galvanized collectors, pushing Pepe into the NFT collective consciousness.

Another card from the Rare Pepe collection was sold for $500k (147 ETH) on 10th of September 2021, the collection’s (almost) fifth birthday, renewing interest in the 2016 NFT series. The card in question was a Series 1 RAREPEPE, the Nakamoto Card.

## **Sotheby's auction**

On 9th of September 2021 the Head of Contemporary Art Auction and Co-Head of NFTs at Sotheby’s, Max Moore, posted a cryptic [tweet](https://twitter.com/MaxMoore\_Art/status/1436003229498687489?s=20\&t=di2R15jDKEYwq6sVXg7wOw) on his profile mentioning the collection's fifth birthday and floating the idea of a potential Sotheby’s auction.

Later next month, on 7th of October, Sotheby’s official Twitter account [announced](https://twitter.com/Sothebys/status/1446199243820216322?s=20\&t=uzKsckt8zNBFtOSbIzrhbQ) their second dedicated NFT sale - “Natively Digital 1.2: The Collectors”. The sale showcased 53 NFTs from 19 different collectors that had been handpicked by Sotheby’s.

3 of the 53 showcased NFTs were Rare Pepes, auctioned by TokenAngles, an Italian collector active in the space since 2019 and the owner of the famous HOMERPEPE.
