# Unique Rare Pepe Sets

A few Rare Pepe artists saw the project as an ongoing tale and often developed a set or a series of cards. It is sometimes hard to pick them out when viewing all 1,774 cards but when brought together you see their brilliance and foresight. Below are some examples of this.

**"History of Art" Series by DanDarkPill**

The Rare Pepe History of Art Series is a collection of Rare Pepe, all in series 8, by the anonymous twitter personality Dan Dark Pill, designed in the style of famous artists such as Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, and Salvador Dali. The collection was intended to be 24 cards, but only seven were completed (#1-6 and #8). Although 100 supply of each pepe were minted, 86 or more of each card is believed to be in a counterparty wallet for whom the private keys are permanently lost, making these cards extraordinarily rare and valuable. Less than 5 complete sets are known to exist, and one is available at auction house Scarce City for prospective buyers.

**â€œHip-Hop Elements Series" by Rare Scrilla**

This series 4 collection was created by long-time Rare Pepe and Fake Rare contributor Rare Scrilla to celebrate the elements of hip-hop music: DJs, MCs, graffiti, and break dancing. DJPEPE is an iconic Rare Pepe, as it is one of the few that offers bonus content (a link to soundcloud playlist of Rare Scrilla), and the first known music NFT ever.
