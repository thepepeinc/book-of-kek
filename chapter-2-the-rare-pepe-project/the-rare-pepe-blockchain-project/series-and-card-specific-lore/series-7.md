**Series 7 Card 27** - [PEPECENT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECENT) was created by the artist known as [OE](https://pepe.wtf/artists/OE) ([@EverydayEarth](https://twitter.com/EverydayEarth) on Twitter). The [source](https://youtu.be/Lz\_ffG6Loik) for the gif used on the card comes from the [HBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO) comedy-drama series [_Entourage_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entourage\_\(American\_TV\_series\)) in Season 6, Episode 3: "One Car, Two Car, Red Car, Blue Car," which originally aired on July 26th, 2009 and featuring cameo appearance by Curtis Jackson, better known by his stage name 50 Cent. In the episode, [50 Cent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50\_Cent) drives up next to [Turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle\_\(Entourage\))'s (played by [Jerry Ferrara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry\_Ferrara)) convertible Ferrari at a red light, pokes fun at his car before driving away.

OE added a Pepe in the back seat of the car and gave him a tattoo that reads "Spud Life." In a [recent interview](https://youtu.be/BJDyiDyvhJQ), OE said that the tattoo is a reference a 2017 meme of an actor who revealed that he had a [potato tattoo](https://metro.co.uk/2017/10/14/rhod-gilbert-reveals-weird-potato-tattoo-during-saturday-kitchen-segment-and-viewers-are-shook-7000162). He also added a [teardrop tattoo](https://www.theskullandsword.com/teardrop-tattoo-meaning/) under Pepe's left eye, which in West Coast gang culture signifies that the person murdered someone in jail. &#x20;
