## Series 1, Card 1 - RAREPEPE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C01 - RAREPEPE card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 1, Card 1 -** [**RAREPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RAREPEPE) is the card that started it all. The anonymous artist that goes only by "[Mike](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Mike)" posted a link to this asset on the Counterparty platform on September 9, 2016 with little explanation. He was also the first and only "Rare Pepe Scientist" for cards 1 - 1,000. The image is a parody of Dorian Nakamoto who was falsely identified as the real Satoshi Nakamoto in a [high-profile article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi\_Nakamoto) in the US magazine "Newsweek" on March 6, 2014.

## Series 1, Card 2 - GOXPEPE

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C02 - GOXPEPE card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 2 -** [**GOXPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GOXPEPE) was created by "Mike" the same person who started the whole Rare Pepe project when he released the above RAREPEPE card. He also created [SHITCOINCARD](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SHITCOINCARD), [TRUMPRARE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TRUMPRARE), [PEPECASH](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECASH), and [UFOPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/UFOPEPE). Mike was also the first Rare Pepe Scientist. He took on the responsibility of examining each card submission and approving the very best for inclusion in the Rare Pepe Directory. The person pictured on the card is [Mark Karpelès](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\_Karpel%C3%A8s) who was the former CEO of the Bitcoin exchange Mt. GOX. Karpelès was [arrested](https://www.ndtv.com/business/former-ceo-of-collapsed-mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-arrested-in-japan-report-1202733) in Japan in 2015 for allegations of fraud that led to the collapes of [Mt. Gox.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt.\_Gox)

## Series 1, Card 3 - SHITCOINCARD

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C03 - SHITCOINCARD.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 1, Card 3** - [SHITCOINCARD](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SHITCOINCARD) was created by the man that started the Rare Pepe project - [Mike](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Mike). Not much is known about Mike except that he created a total of 6 cards for the Rare Pepe project and was the first Rare Pepe Scientist. To Bitcoin maximalists, every other project is considered a "shitcoin." In this card, Mike takes a jab at people who bought or traded them and called out [Litecoin](https://litecoin.com/en/), [Maza](https://www.mazacoin.org/), and [NuBits](https://nubits.com/) specifically.&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 4 - PEPENATION

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C04 - PEPENATION card and source.jpg>)

## Series 1, Card 6 - TRUMPRARE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C06 - TRUMPRARE card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 1, Card 6** - [TRUMPRARE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TRUMPRARE) was created by a man known only as [Mike](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Mike). Not only did Mike create this card, but he started the whole Rare Pepe project when he released the iconic [RAREPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RAREPEPE) card and became the first Rare Pepe Scientist. The card is a parody of the 45th [President of the United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President\_of\_the\_United\_States) - [Donald J. Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald\_Trump). The text on the card make reference to Mr. Trumps campaign promise to [build a wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump\_wall) at the United States and Mexico border, his love of winning, making business deals, and his daughter [Ivanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka\_Trump).&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 7 - PEPEPARTY

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C07 - PEPEPARTY card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 7 -** [**PEPEPARTY**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEPARTY) was another masterpiece created by Joe Looney (see [STILLPEPE](series-1.md#series-1-card-10-stillpepe) for further information about Joe). The card depicts three [Counterparty](https://counterparty.io/) developers - [Evan Wagner](https://counterparty.io/team/evan-wagner/) (Top Left), [Robby Dermody](https://counterparty.io/team/robby-dermody/)[ ](https://counterparty.io/team/matt-young/)(Top Right), and [Adam Krellenstein](https://counterparty.io/team/adam-krellenstein/) (Bottom). Bitcoin maximalists get angry at Counterparty users for trading Rare Pepes and other assets on "their" blockchain. Thus Joe's tongue-in-cheek "Spamming the block chain since January 2014" comment. In reality, they should be thanking Counterparty users. They gave Bitcoin one of it's first true use cases.&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 8 - KEISERPEPE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C08 - KEISERPEPE card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 1, Card 11** - [PEPECASH](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECASH) was created by [Mike. ](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Mike)Not only was PEPECASH a Series 1 card, it quickly became the de facto currency of Rare Pepe card buyers and sellers. In late 2017 PEPECASH received the same categorization as Bitcoin as a “first class” cryptocurrency in Japan, and [one of only 17 digital tokens](https://www.techinasia.com/japan-approved-crypto-exchanges) that could be legally be traded at the time.&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 12 - LOVEPEPETATO

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C12 - LOVEPEPETATO card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The subject of this card is the President of Venezuela [Nicolás Maduro Moros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s\_Maduro) in front of some of the [many slums](https://migrazioniontheroad.largemovements.it/petare-venezuela-slum/) in the country.

## Series 1, Card 14 - GURUPEPE

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C14 - GURUPEPE card and source (1).jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 14 -** [**GURUPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GURUPEPE) was created by artist, auctioneer extraordinaire, and all around good guy [Theo Goodman](https://twitter.com/theog\_\_). He also created the Series 1 cards [PEPENATION](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPENATION), [KEISERPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/KEISERPEPE), [HYIPPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/HYIPPEPE), and [PONZIPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PONZIPEPE) along with several other great cards such as [EGGPLANTPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/EGGPLANTPEPE) and [GROYPERMONKY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GROYPERMONKY).

The man pictured on the card is [Vinay Gupta](https://medium.com/@leashless), Co-Founder of Ethereum. As Theo put it, "he calls himself a GURU. He says a lot of random shit that "sounds smart" and sometimes has some good moments but also some like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d0pbn/how\_do\_you\_feel\_about\_vinay\_gupta\_saying\_that\_all/). It's funny, he kind of just went out of the spotlight, after making mega-millions during the first bull run of ETH. He was a major part of the founding of ETH, but many people from this wave have no idea who he is. Sure, a big guy that has trouble walking, saying that he is going to break peoples bones because they are white and buddist, is a great style. WATCH OUT he comes from a linage of warriors! The main issue is I've never seen him laugh at himself once."

[Here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahulsingireddy/2017/10/18/vinay-gupta-on-why-ethereum-is-the-future/?sh=3e809c6856f2) is a lengthy article about him from Forbes. While researching the card, I asked the question "who is displayed in GURUPEPE?" to Theo, when Rare Pepe OG [Shawn Leary](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Shawn-Leary) jumped in with the answer. When I agreed with him, he followed up with one of the greatest one liners in Rare Pepe History: "I know I'm right. I'm a retired Rare Pepe Scientist." I should have known better than to question [Shawn](https://twitter.com/shawnleary)!&#x20;

![Flamed again!](<../../../.gitbook/assets/GURUPEPE edit.png>)

## Series 1, Card 15 - HYIPPEPE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C15 - HYIPPEPE.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 1, Card 15** - [HYIPPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/HYIPPEPE) was created by [Theo Goodman](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Theo-Goodman). Theo is a retired Rare Pepe scientist, artist, and auctioneer. He had this to say about HYIPPEPE and PONZIPEPE (animated version), "On HYIPPEPE and [PONZIPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PONZIPEPE) are the top ponzis of the time, including [ONECOIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneCoin), [MMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMM\_\(Ponzi\_scheme\_company\)), [SWISSCOIN](https://news.bitcoin.com/dissecting-swisscoin-cryptocurrency-ponzi-horizon/) and the first telegram bot ponzi (I forgot the name, maybe just telegram robot) at the time all of these were making the rounds and had a major impact on the crypto landscape. MMM is older than bitcoin and had a crypto version that went wild in 2016."&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 16 - PEPETRATION

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C16 - PEPETRATION.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This was their only submission to the Rare Pepe project. The artist drew a [wojak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojak) family celebrating the US holiday of [Thanksgiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving), replacing the traditional [turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey\_\(bird\)) with a Pepe and a the [turkey baster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basting\_\(cooking\)) with a [green candle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick\_chart). &#x20;

## Series 1, Card 17 - DARKPILLPEPE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C17 - DARKPILLPEPE copy.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Series 1, Card 18 - HAIRPEPE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C18 - HAIRPEPE.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 1, Card 18** - [HAIRPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/HAIRPEPE) was created by [ayaLAN](https://twitter.com/ayaLAN) who sadly lost the keys to the wallet it was issued from. This card is considered a "grail" by most in the Rare Pepe community due to its unique look. The text on the card reference [Pantene](https://pantene.com/en-us) hair products and [Maybelline](https://www.maybelline.com/) makeup. The card is also highly sought after because it permits entry to one of earliest art-based private Telegram rooms - "The Salon." A [Telegram bot](https://github.com/chiguireitor/telly-kickbot) scans your wallet for the card. If it is present, it grants you entry to the private room. If you ever move the card out of the wallet you used to gain entry (to sell it for example), the bot would kick you out of the room during one of it's frequent wallet scans.

&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 19 - LUCKYPEPE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C19 - LUCKYPEPE card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The subject of this card is the [maneki-neko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneki-neko) or "beckoning cat," a common Japanese figurine which is believed to bring good luck to shop owners. The earliest records of _maneki-neko_ appear in the Bukō nenpyō's (a chronology of [Edo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo)) entry dated 1852. Because of its popularity in Chinese and Vietnamese communities (including [Chinatowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown) in the United States), the _maneki-neko_ is frequently mistaken for being Chinese in origin rather than Japanese, and is therefore sometimes referred to as a "Chinese lucky cat."

## Series 1, Card 20 - CHERPEPEFOIL

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C20 - CHERPEPEFOIL card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 1, Card 20** - [CHERPEPEFOIL](https://pepe.wtf/asset/CHERPEPEFOIL) was created by the late great [John Villar](https://pepe.wtf/artists/John-Villar). He may hold the record for most Rare Pepe cards in the project at 80. John created 50 cards specifically for the game [Rare Pepe Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfPkrAo25DM\&ab\_channel=JohnVillar) which he was working on at the time of his passing and another 40 cards beyond that including what is probably the first interactive digital art token - [PEPEBALT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEBALT).

This card is a pepefied image of the American singer, actress and television personality [Cher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher). The card quotes a lyric from her song [Believe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Believe\_\(Cher\_song\))

## Series 1, Card 21 - PEPEBROS

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C21 - PEPEBROS card and source (1).jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 1, Card 21** - [PEPEBROS](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEBROS) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1698Gs1WEs8pyvLoyYZWVqhbBGE5uYCmSL). They only created two cards for the Rare Pepe project. The other one being [MAGICPEPEYE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/MAGICPEPEYE).&#x20;

This card pays homage to the 1985 platform game developed by [Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo) for the [Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo\_Entertainment\_System) (NES) called [Super Mario Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super\_Mario\_Bros.) It appears that the artist created his own scene from the game, or perhaps took a scene, increased the size until it was at a 1:1 pixel ratio and then added the sun with the face of a [Wojak](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wojak). &#x20;

## Series 1, Card 22 - DAOPEPEHACK

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C22 - DAOPEPEHACK card and source.jpg>)

The person depicted in the card is [Stephan Tual](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/stephan-tual), the CCO of the Ethereum Foundation at the time of the first major hack on any blockchain entitled the [DAO Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_DAO\_\(organization\)) which ultimately split the Ethereum community into two camps - those that believed the blockchain should be rolled back to the pre-hack state and those that did not. This resulted in the formation of ETC or [Ethereum Classic](https://ethereumclassic.org/). [Here](https://medium.com/decentralize-today/q-a-stephan-tual-former-cco-of-ethereum-and-founder-of-slock-it-the-dao-cf934fe28a4c) is an interview with Stephan that was done on Medium by [Ameer Rosic](https://medium.com/@ameerrosic).&#x20;

She is wanted for defrauding victims out of more than 4 billion dollars. [Here](https://briefly.co.za/105908-ruja-ignatova-where-founder-ponzi-scheme-onecoin.html) is some further reading about Ignatova.

**Series 1 Card 25 -** [**PEPEVIAGRA**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEVIAGRA) was created by [DanDarkPill](https://pepe.wtf/artists/DanDarkPill). In the mid-1840s, ukiyo-e master [Utagawa Kuniyoshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utagawa\_Kuniyoshi) (1797-1861) created a number of woodblock prints showing legendary [tanuki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuki) (raccoon dogs) using their humorously large scrota in creative ways. You can view them [here](http://pinktentacle.com/2009/06/all-purpose-tanuki-testicles-prints-by-kuniyoshi/). In 2016 Dan took it upon himself to update Kuniyoshi's image by turning the Rokurokubi into a Pepe and the wielder of the monster a Wojak.&#x20;
