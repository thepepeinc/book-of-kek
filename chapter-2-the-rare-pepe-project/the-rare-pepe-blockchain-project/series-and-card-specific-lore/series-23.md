# Series 23

## Series 23, Card 1 - GUYBRUSH

For the start of Series 23, [MrHansel](https://twitter.com/bettidlomas) created "[GUYBRUSH ](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GUYBRUSH)THREEPEPE", a takeoff on the name of the lead character Guybrush Threepwood from the 1991 LucasArts Personal Computer game "[Monkey Island 2, LeChuck's Revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey\_Island\_2:\_LeChuck's\_Revenge)". I have no idea how someone could 1 - play or remember playing a 21 year old game that only sold 25,000 copies, 2 - grab a stock image of the character, 3 - overlay that onto a background that only appears once in the entire game, and 4 - decide that would make a great Pepe! They say there is a fine line between genius and madness and I would say MrHansel is 100% the former.  &#x20;
