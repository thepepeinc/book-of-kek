**Series 22, Card 7** - [CREWLOVEPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/CREWLOVEPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1Lmy7WxetaSMrCodyczDgjb6ELeJu78KiC).  The card is an edited version of the 2011 mixtape by [Young Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young\_Money\_Entertainment) titled ["Crew Love Vol 1 Mixtape"](https://mixtapewire.com/2011/08/young-money-crew-love-vol-1-mixtape/). The face used for the man on the far left was also used for the Rare Pepe card [BADASSPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BADASSPEPE) by the same artist.&#x20;

Series 22, Card 34 - PEPEHARING was created by the French artist [Zed Erwan](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Zed-Erwan). All but 2 of Erwan's 12 Rare Pepe cards were hand drawn or painted. Along with the above parody, he also parodied works by Grant Wood ([GOTHICPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GOTHICPEPE)), Andy Warhol ([PEPESOUP](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPESOUP)), Roy Lichtenstein ([PEPELCHTNSTN](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPELCHTNSTN)), Jackson Pollock ([PEPEPOLLOCK](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEPOLLOCK)), and Paul Cézanne ([PEPECEZANNE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECEZANNE)).&#x20;

In chatting with Erwan via DM on Twitter he told me "I had trouble finding pepeharing, I was doing things that were too complicated, and then I found, and it was obvious." And shared the image below.
