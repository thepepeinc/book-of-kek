<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S22 C04 - SCHROEPEPE card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 22, Card 4** - [SCHROEPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SCHROEPEPE) was created by the artist [netidx](https://pepe.wtf/artists/netidx) in April 2017. It is one of only two cards created by netidx. The other being [RUBIXPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RUBIXPEPE). SCHROEPEPE is a one-of-a-kind card. The artist, whose real name is Gilles, used a PNG rendering exploit that varies the card's appearance (dead pepe, or alive pepe) depending on the software or device used to display it. You can read an interview with the artist about the process he used to create the image [here](https://www.redlion.news/article/rarepepes-the-origin-story).&#x20;

The Artist coded the token in a way that depending on where you look at it, you could either see a dead pepe or an alive pepe. Not only is that historical in it self because this is the first Rare Pepe card to do something like this. The card's images reference the thought experiment [_Schrödinger's cat_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's\_cat)_._

In quantum mechanics, Schrödinger's thought experiment illustrates a paradox of quantum superposition. In the thought experiment, a hypothetical cat may be considered simultaneously both alive and dead, while it is unobserved in a closed box, as a result of its fate being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. This thought experiment was devised by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935 in a discussion with Albert Einstein to illustrate what Schrödinger saw as the problems of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. In English? Pretty much the thought experiment says that everything exists in more than one state all the time. Depending on what space and time you look at it is and only is when you can see what state it is in. It was an infamous debate between Eintein and Schrödinger. But no body could prove who was corect back then because there was no way to measure atoms. Until 2022 when 3 physicists won the Nobel prize in physics proving that Einstein was wrong and Schrödinger was correct by, simply put; [proving the bells theorem to be true](https://www.quantamagazine.org/pioneering-quantum-physicists-win-nobel-prize-in-physics-20221004/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw3a2iBhCFARIsAD4jQB2aGGqRefgivDnma-SNAXSLszuxPp8qQoCGNINv8DYXdqvz-FBWKcYaAlrQEALw\_wcB).

So netidx and the SCHROEPEPE card sided with Schrödinger and predicted that he was correct back in 2017, way before it was actually proven by the three physicists in 2022. Rare Pepes have magical powers and can predict the future...

**Series 22, Card 7** - [CREWLOVEPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/CREWLOVEPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1Lmy7WxetaSMrCodyczDgjb6ELeJu78KiC).  The card is an edited version of the 2011 mixtape by [Young Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young\_Money\_Entertainment) titled ["Crew Love Vol 1 Mixtape"](https://mixtapewire.com/2011/08/young-money-crew-love-vol-1-mixtape/). The face used for the man on the far left was also used for the Rare Pepe card [BADASSPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BADASSPEPE) by the same artist.&#x20;

**Series 22, Card 23** - [PEPENAL](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPENAL) was created by the Japanese artist known as [Oni Giri](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Oni-Giri). She created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project; 8 of which are original artworks! Oni had this to say about this card, "it is based on my love of [Final Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final\_Fantasy\_\(video\_game\)), this is the four [Warriors of Dawn ](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Warriors\_of\_Dawn)from [FF5](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final\_Fantasy\_V). I tried to express [Yoshitaka Amano](https://www.yoshitakaamano.com/about)'s touch. I personally like this card very much. I think it was more popular back in 2017 than it is now."

## Series 22, Card 34 - PEPEHARING

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S22 C34 - PEPEHARING source and card.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Series 22, Card 34 - PEPEHARING was created by the French artist [Zed Erwan](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Zed-Erwan). All but 2 of Erwan's 12 Rare Pepe cards were hand drawn or painted. Along with the above parody, he also parodied works by Grant Wood ([GOTHICPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GOTHICPEPE)), Andy Warhol ([PEPESOUP](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPESOUP)), Roy Lichtenstein ([PEPELCHTNSTN](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPELCHTNSTN)), Jackson Pollock ([PEPEPOLLOCK](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEPOLLOCK)), and Paul Cézanne ([PEPECEZANNE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECEZANNE)).&#x20;

In chatting with Erwan via DM on Twitter he told me "I had trouble finding pepeharing, I was doing things that were too complicated, and then I found, and it was obvious." And shared the image below.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S22 C46 - FIGHTSYSTEM source and card.jpg>)

**Series 22, Card 46** - [FIGHTSYSTEM](https://pepe.wtf/asset/FIGHTSYSTEM) was created by the artist [Hosherama](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Hosherama) ([@ThreedmakerG](https://twitter.com/ThreedmakerG) on Twitter). Hosherama had a total of 16 cards accepted into the Rare Pepe project including [DRSTRNGEPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/DRSTRNGEPEPE), [BOWLPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BOWLPEPE), and a claymation card - [PEPESUPREME](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPESUPREME). The GIF on the card is taken from the 1991 [Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo\_Entertainment\_System) game [**Zombie Nation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie\_Nation\_\(video\_game\)). The game was first released in Japan on 14 December, 1990 under the title **Abarenbou Tengu.** You can see a full walkthrough of the game below. The portion of the game that was used for the card can be seen at the 13:38 minute mark.

## Series 22, Card 50 - PEPETREK

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S22 C50 - PEPETREK card and source.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 22, Card 50** - [PEPETREK](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPETREK) was created by the Japanese artist known as [Mekabu](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Mekabu). The source image for the card was taken from Season One, Episode Five of the American science fiction television series, [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\_Trek:\_The\_Original\_Series). The title of the episode is "[The Enemy Within](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Enemy\_Within\_\(Star\_Trek:\_The\_Original\_Series\))." The artist chose this episode because it is "one of the best philosophical stories in the ORIGINAL. I felt it was a fitting tribute to the misused Pepe, who continues to walk away with his shadow side as well."\
\
I asked Mekabu if they have Star Trek in Japan. His response was "I first watched Star Trek when I was in high school. It was on late at night and I remember rubbing my sleepy eyes as I watched it. I don't remember the series, but it was "StarTrek: The Next Generation" that was on the air at the time. After that I watched DS9, BEYOND, INTO DARKNESS, Discovery, and PICARD. I have also watched some older series, but not all."
