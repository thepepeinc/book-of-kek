**Series 25, Card 9** - [TOBIASPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TOBIASPEPE) was commissioned by @Whatever from the official Telegram chat room and created by the artist [OE](https://pepe.wtf/artists/OE). It is a homage to the character [Tobias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Arrested\_Development\_characters#Tobias\_F%C3%BCnke) from the American television sitcom [Arrested Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested\_Development). Tobias was played by the stand-up comedian [David Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_Cross). The original image was taken from Episode 7 of Season 1 entitled ["In God We Trust"](https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/In\_God\_We\_Trust).  OE shared some early drafts of this iconic card in the Telegram recently stating, "It went through a couple iterations before reaching its final dankness."

**Series 25, Card 17 -** [YAMAPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/YAMAPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1ye1EaLcArtidUSqATkkgzCS4Fj2D4Gpe). The card depicts Japanese right-wing ultranationalist [Otoya Yamaguchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otoya\_Yamaguchi) just moments before he stabbed [Inejirō Asanuma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inejir%C5%8D\_Asanuma), chairman of the [Japan Socialist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan\_Socialist\_Party) on October 12, 1960. Yamaguchi stabbed Asanuma with a wakizashi short sword during a live televised election debate in Tokyo. Yamaguchi was only 17 at the time. The photograph was taken by a Japanese photojournalist named [Yasushi Nagao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasushi\_Nagao) and won him a [Pulitzer Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer\_Prize) in 1961.\

The background of the card is a modified version of an album cover for the song "[Fast and Fresh](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/fast-and-fresh-feat-asteroide-single/1483620621)" by the artist Akuan.

## Series 25, Card 20 - PEAKYPEPE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S25 C20 - PEAKYPEPE card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 25, Card 20** - [PEAKYPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEAKYPEPE) was created by  RarePepeTrader, who is an OG in the Rare Pepe Telegram group and runs the WTH Auction House.&#x20;

The card was modeled after a still image from the English crime drama television series [Peaky Blinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky\_Blinders\_\(TV\_series\)#Cast\_and\_characters)' main character [Tommy Shelby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy\_Shelby), played by [Cillian Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian\_Murphy).

RPT stated recently in the official Rare Pepe Telegram chat room that he made the issuance of the card 1,921 because that was the year portrayed in the first season of the show. However [this article](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/when-is-peaky-blinders-set) states that Series 1 took place in 1919 and Series 2 took place in 1921 so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

She created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project; 8 of which are original artworks! Oni said of PEPEHAND, "Something is about to be born beyond the sadness. I also feel anger and resentment. What do you think is born from destroying something? What you see beyond that may change depending on the owner of the card."
