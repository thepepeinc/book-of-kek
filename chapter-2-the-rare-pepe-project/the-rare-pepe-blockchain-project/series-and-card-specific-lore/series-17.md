The image on the card is taken from the cover of a 1990 board game expansion pack called [**Space Hulk: Genestealer Expansion.**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13393/space-hulk-genestealer-expansion) The board game [Space Hulk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Hulk) was released in 1989 by the company [Games Workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games\_Workshop). The card creator had a total of 8 cards accepted into the Rare Pepe project including what has to be one of the earliest known examples of a vIRL (virtual in real life) - [PEPETSHIRT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPETSHIRT). In this case, purchasing the digital asset PEPETSHIRT entitled you to an actual tee shirt being sent to your home as well as a "receipt" in the form of another digital asset - [GOTPEPESHIRT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GOTPEPESHIRT).&#x20;

**Series 17, Card 25** - [THEVERYPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/THEVERYPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1P1JukVHAHwqQcSKhPBgTsPp4oiR33163s). This was one of two cards that they contributed to the Rare Pepe series. The other being [THESKYPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/THESKYPEPE).

The image on the card is a man dressed up as the character [Gachapin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gachapin) from the Japanese television program [Hirake! Ponkikki](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15227182/), and its succeeding series, [Ponkickies](https://en.moegirl.org.cn/Ponkickies). He is a green, bucktoothed dinosaur and is usually accompanied by his friend [Muku](http://ilovetheyeti.blogspot.com/2009/06/mukku-yeti.html), a red Yeti. The [Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) roughly translates to "Bring it on", or "Come on" as it's written bellow. It seems that the human Gachapin wants to fight someone.&#x20;
