**Series 18, Card 4** - [LUPEPEN](https://pepe.wtf/asset/LUPEPEN) was created by the artist [Luca](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Luca) ([@Rare\_Luca](https://twitter.com/Rare\_Luca) on Twitter). Luca created 18 cards for the Rare Pepe series including the popular [PEPEBASQUIAT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEBASQUIAT), the tranquil [KOIPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/KOIPEPE), [PEPECLUB](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECLUB), and [PEPEFICTION](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPFICTION).&#x20;

The images were taken from the Japanese animated made-for-TV film [Lupin III (Part 4)](https://theartarchivee.com/2018/07/28/retro-retrospective-lupin-iii-part-4/). These films, staring the [Manga character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupin\_the\_Third) of the same name aired yearly between 1989 and 2013. The sign at the bottom left appears to be taken from the [2014 Mt. Gox protestors](https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/19/5425220/protest-at-mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-in-tokyo).

**Series 18, Card 10** - [PEPEKYRIE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEKYRIE) was created by [Ariya Minase](https://twitter.com/aria\_minase). She created a total of four cards for the Rare Pepe series including the Pok√©mon parody [BULBAPEPECRD](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BULBAPEPECRD). The card is an adaptation of the 1989 Japanese arcade game [Valkyrie no Densetsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie\_no\_Densetsu). The game describes Valkyrie's companion Kurino Xandra as "lizard-like" but we all know it's really a frog . &#x20;

## Series 18, Card 18 - PEPEBEARD

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S18 C18 - PEPEBEARD card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 18, Card 18** - [PEPEBEARD](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEBEARD) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1Gpe8KHgZpgzpVLwri1UnU99wwCUWmm3cs). They created a total of nine Rare Pepe cards for the series including [BATBUTBOO](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BATBUTBOO) which is a very funny story behind it which can be found in the [Series 12 section](https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/series-and-card-specific-lore/series-12).  \
\
PEPEBEARD is a parody of the purported [flag of Blackbeard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag\_of\_Blackbeard) which was attributed to Edward Teach (or Thatch), who was better known as [Blackbeard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard) the Pirate. As you can see from the image above, the original flag did not contain the severed head of [Wojak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojak) (or anyone else for that matter).&#x20;

## Series 18, Card 19 - KEKTOPUS

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S18 C19 - KEKTOPUS card and source copy.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 18, Card 19** - [KEKTOPUS](https://pepe.wtf/asset/KEKTOPUS) was created by the artist known as [Meme Conscious](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Meme-Conscious). He created at total of 13 cards for the Rare Pepe project.

This card appears to be a parody of an [Anne Tavoletti](https://www.instagram.com/anne\_tavoletti/) painting called [Deep Sea II](https://www.allposters.com/-sp/Deep-Sea-II-Posters\_i16246478\_.htm). As you can see from the image above if you flip it and rotate it a bit it's nearly identical. Perhaps Mr. Conscious used Deep Sea II reference material and painted his own version.

## Series 18, Card 25 - BTFDPEPE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S18 C25 - BTFDPEPE card and source.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 18, Card 25** - [BTFDPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BTFDPEPE) was created by the duo of Rare Pepe Scientist Bench and OG Grass Fed Goat. Together, they go by the name [Cryptonati](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Cryptonati). They created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project including [CHYNAPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/CHYNAPEPE), [KILLARYPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/KILLARYPEPE), and [PEPETRADERS](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPETRADERS). Somehow Bench got this card approved while breaking two of the cardinal rules - "No websites.. QR codes" and "no NSFW content." If you look on the shelf just in front of the pepe/bull head you will see the first broken rule, and behind Mr. Draper you will see the second (hint, it's neon green).&#x20;

The original image was taken from a [Coindesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/02/vc-tim-draper-revealed-as-silk-road-bitcoin-auction-winner/) from 2014 that announced that the venture capitalist [Tim Draper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim\_Draper) was the winning bidder of all 29,656 bitcoins that were auctioned off by the US Marshals.  The bitcoins were those that were seized by the US government when they shut down the online marketplace called [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk\_Road\_\(marketplace\)). I could not get my phone to read it, but Bench let me know that it leads to the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain where the Bitcoins purchased by Draper were transferred into his wallet.   &#x20;
