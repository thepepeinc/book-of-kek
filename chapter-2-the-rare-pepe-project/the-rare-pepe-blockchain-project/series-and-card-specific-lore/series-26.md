**Series 26, Card 25** - [TETSUWANPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TETSUWANPEPE) was created by the artist known as [Easy B](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Easy-B). Mr. B created a whopping 39 cards for the Rare Pepe project! TETSUWANPEPE is the artists rendition of the Japanese Manga character [Astro Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro\_Boy). Also known as Mighty Atom, the android young boy with human emotions was created by [Osamu Tezuka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu\_Tezuka) and was published by [Kobunsha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobunsha) from 1952 to 1968. In a [recent interview](https://youtu.be/SEL23QKS\_SQ) with Zero G, Easy B displayed his first attempt at his TETSUWANPEPE card (pictured below) which was rejected by the Rare Pepe Scientists with the comment, "needs more original content."&#x20;

## Series 26, Card 45 - HAPPYRAINY

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S26 C45 - HAPPYRAINY.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Series 26, Card 45 - [HAPPYRAINY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/HAPPYRAINY) is an original drawing by the Japanese artist known as [Mekabu](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Mekabu). I asked him about it recently and this was his response, "In Japan, the rainy season is called "TSUYU", which is between spring and summer, from the end of May to mid-July. Frogs, hydrangeas, and snails are the standard illustrations for "TSUYU". HAPPYRAINY is just like that. The main subject of this illustration is rain, so I have added a blank space at the top to show the presence of clouds and rain. Please also pay attention to his gaze."
