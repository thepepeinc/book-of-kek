<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Rare Apepe Genesis</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By Pepe Designer (Aka Rare Designer)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">After <a href="https://pepe.wtf"><span class="s2">Pepe the Frog</span></a> originated in a comic by Matt Furie, Pepe the Frog grew in popularity through to 2015 as an apolitical open source meme for the Internet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Oscar Wilde once wrote “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness", and this remains clearly evident in the explosion of Pepe the Frog derivatives from "<a href="https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-1-historical-lore/the-creation-pepe-the-frog/4chan-and-the-sad-frog"><span class="s2">Sad Frog</span></a>", "<a href="https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-1-historical-lore/the-creation-pepe-the-frog/types-of-pepes%23smug-frog-the-smug-pepe"><span class="s2">Smug Frog</span></a>", "<a href="https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-1-historical-lore/the-creation-pepe-the-frog/types-of-pepes?q%3Dangry%2Bfrog"><span class="s2">Angry Pepe</span></a>'' and "<a href="https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-1-historical-lore/the-creation-pepe-the-frog/types-of-pepes"><span class="s2">Feels Frog</span></a>" through to the more design intensive animated memes of today.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The success of Pepe can be directly linked to the organic community network effect of an open source art protocol. In the early days, Memes were primarily produced and distributed by highly active and extremely creative community members looking to ‘out meme’ each other, further amplifying the network effect of Pepe the Frog. Today, these highly active community members continue their art, with much more effective distribution methods with a greater reach, further accelerating the Pepe network effect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Pepe the Frog is considered by some as a platform agnostic art meme, which transcends social and technology network barriers of each decade of the 21st century from 4chan, MySpace, Gaia Online and Tumblr in the early years, to the more current social platforms of Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Clubhouse and Telegram today.  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Although originally an apolitical character, in 2015 to 2016, for a brief period, Pepe the Frog was appropriated as a symbol of the alt-right movement, but Matt Furie took the necessary steps to regain control of the Pepe image as an apolitical open source meme for the Web Counter-culture.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">During the influential period, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><span class="s2">BTC</span></a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://counterparty.io"><span class="s2">Counterparty</span></a>, <a href="https://counterparty.io/docs/faq-xcp/"><span class="s2">XCP</span></a> and <a href="https://etherscan.io/"><span class="s2">ETH</span></a> were firmly establishing themselves as monetary and technological foundations for what is now more prominently known as Web-3, which can be defined as the Immutable verification of the ownership era of Read-Write-Own Capability on the internet.</span><span class="s3"> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Between 2016 and 2018, <a href="https://rarepepes.com"><span class="s2">Rare Pepe</span></a>, a crypto project created by various artists based on the aforementioned meme and traded as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) recorded on the <a href="https://counterparty.io"><span class="s2">CounterParty</span></a> platform. A total of <a href="https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/fake-rares-and-dank-rares/fake-rare-artists"><span class="s2">1,774 official cards</span></a> were released for the project across 36 series. What followed numerous new Pepep card collection derivatives like ‘<a href="https://pepe.wtf/collection"><span class="s2">Fake Rares</span></a>’ and ‘<a href="https://pepe.wtf/collection/dank-rares"><span class="s2">Dank Rares</span></a>’ collections.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In 2017, <a href="https://pepe.wtf/artists/RareDesigner"><span class="s2">Pepe Designer (Aka Rare Designer)</span></a> created his First Pepe the Frog memes on the BTC blockchain. Pepe Designer was introduced to Pepe the Frog and BTC through a potential client, who offered him $300 in Bitcoin to create 3 illustrations. His client went on to introduce him to the Rare Pepe Wallet project, one of the first platforms to allow for buying and selling art on the Bitcoin blockchain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Pepe Designer took to Counterculture like a ‘Frog to Water’ as he began a prolific Pepe career, creating <a href="https://pepe.wtf/artists/RareDesigner"><span class="s2">Pepe digital trading cards</span></a>, starting with ‘One Punch Pepe’ which opened the door to more opportunities in this new decentralized world of crypto art. With BTC increasing in popularity and value, this period became a pivotal turning point in Rare Designer’s career, culminating in the creation of his most celebrated work on March 14th, 2018 when Pepe Designer released <a href="https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPALISA"><span class="s2">Pepe Lisa</span></a>, one of his most notorious pieces in the Pepe space.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In parallel to Pepe Designer's growth as a Pepe OG artist in Counterculture Web-3, before it was called NFTs, the cyber punk communities birthed <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks"><span class="s2">CryptoPunks</span></a>. Originally free to acquire for anyone with an ETH wallet, CryptoPunks was launched by studio <a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks"><span class="s2">Larva Labs</span></a> on 23rd June 2017 as a 10,000 pixel art collection.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Building on the success of other projects in the NFT space, Greg Solano, Wylie Aronow, Gordon Goner and Zeshan Ali started <a href="https://twitter.com/yugalabs"><span class="s2">Yuga Labs</span></a>, a Virginia-based company founded in 2021. From there the <a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com"><span class="s2">Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC)</span></a> released a collection of 10,000 unique NFT digital collections of <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub"><span class="s2">Bored Ape</span></a> avatars. Continuing the success of Yuga Labs first collection, the team has since launched <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mutant-ape-yacht-club"><span class="s2">Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC)</span></a> and <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/bored-ape-kennel-club"><span class="s2">Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC)</span></a> collections, each with a strong, loyal and vibrant communities, each of which continue to grow from strength to strength.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Roman philosopher Seneca once said, “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity". This was definitely the case, when on the 26th of October, 2021, Pepe Designer, a now celebrated OG Pepe artist on BTC blockchain, minted his first Rare Apepe on the Ethereum blockchain, off the back of a private commission by Bored Ape Owner <a href="https://twitter.com/JiroNFT/status/1557009435016499201?s%3D20%26t%3DKMrPr2JDiLuV1ZuFmeBxUA"><span class="s2">Jiro</span></a>, who wanted a Pepe the Frog portrait with the Bored Ape Traits of BAYC-3060.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4"><a href="https://twitter.com/pepe_designer">Rare Designer</a></span><span class="s1"> as he was now know, along with his Co-creator <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/kntrvlr"><span class="s2">KounterVailor</span></a>, encouraged by the success of this commission, proceeded to design, build and launch the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://opensea.io/collection/rareapepeyachtclub"><span class="s2">Rare </span></a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://opensea.io/collection/rareapepeyachtclub"><span class="s2">Apepe</span></a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://opensea.io/collection/rareapepeyachtclub"><span class="s2"> Yacht Club (RAYC)</span></a>, a collection of 10,000 one-of-one Rare Apepes, which in part is an extension of the memetic culture and as a homage to the BAYC collection.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">On March 5th, 2022, as part of the RAYC loir, 'The Arrival' saw a paid mint priced at 0.05 ETH with no whitelist or bonding curve, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/rare_labs"><span class="s2">Rare Labs</span></a> launched the first 1,997 Rare Apepes. After a pause of the mint, and while the Crypto and NFT spaces were in turmoil, 'The Rebellion' ensued. From July 31st, 2022, ID 1,998 resumed and the Rare Apepes broke free from the paid mint, turning into a free mint. The rebellion also saw the Rare Apepes break free from the 1:1 ID match with their BAYC counterparts.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In August 2022, 'the Explosion' occurred. No one knew what was about to happen, even Rare Designer or the Team. The NFT space began to see the project's potential, the passionate and loyal community began to grow organically and these ‘Fros’ as they were affectionately named began producing Rare Apepes memes and derivatives, keeping to the roots of Pepe the Frog, while embracing the Ape like sensibilities. This continued to spark organic growth that enabled the project to navigate towards a direction that was beyond Rare Designers wildest dreams, as the brand established itself as one of the leading 'meme' brands in the NFT Web-3 space.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In October 2022, the Rare Apepe community experienced a Zombie apocalypse as the <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/zombie-apepes"><span class="s2">Zombie Apepe Yacht Club (ZAYC)</span></a> was launched, providing Rare Apepe holders, who claimed their serum, the ability to Spawn a Zombie Apepe based on the Traits of their Rare Apepe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This is only the beginning of the lore, as Rare Designer and the Rare Labs team have officially announced MAPYC collection in 2023, the details of which are unknown, except those holding 1 x RAYC + 1 x ZAYC (matching pairs &amp;  will receive 1 x MAPYC to complete a set of the collections from the same traits. Dubious speculation is rife, but we know Mutants are coming, but what that may look like is left to our imaginations for now as Rare Designer and the team keep their future plans close to their chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Watch this pond closely for more to follow…</span></p>
