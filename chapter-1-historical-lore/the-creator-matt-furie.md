Matt Furie was born in 1979 Columbus, Ohio where he graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware in 2001. He's currently based in Los Angeles.

Matt's art comes from a mix of child-like enchantment and momentary adult situations. His self proclaimed “children’s book illustrations for adults” combines traditional and modern mark-making for his ripe, cartoon-inspired characters.
