Matt Furie was born in 1979 Columbus, Ohio where he graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware in 2001. He's currently based in Los Angeles.

Matt's art comes from a mix of child-like enchantment and momentary adult situations. His self proclaimed “children’s book illustrations for adults” combines traditional and modern mark-making for his ripe, cartoon-inspired characters.

In 1997, Matt Furie, won the distinguished "Award of Merit for 2-D art" at the age of 17 for his achievements in drawing at Worthington Kilbourne High School in suburban Columbus, Ohio.

He has exhibited extensively in the USA and Europe. His comic book series “Boy’s Club” is published by [Fantagraphics](https://www.fantagraphics.com/). In 2012 [McSweeney’s](https://store.mcsweeneys.net/products/night-riders) published Matt’s first children’s book, ‘[The Night Riders](http://50watts.com/The-Night-Riders)’, a wordless tale about the adventures of two best friends, a frog and a rat.

In 2006 "Boy's Club" was published by Teenage Dinosaur and subsequently picked up by Buenaventura Press (who also published "Boy's Club 2" and "Boy's Club 3") and later Fantagraphics. "Boys Club 4," the most recent entry in the series, was published by Pigeon Press in 2011.
